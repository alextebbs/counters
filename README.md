# Counters

This is a really over-engineered web app that lets you create timers which track
events, and add occurrences to those events.

- k8s
- Tilt
- Go
- PostgresQL
- Protobuf
- gRPC
- Typescript
- NextJS 14
- React server actions
- Tailwind

What's interesting about this application is the k8s development setup, and the
generic functions on the frontend that provide interfaces and helpers for
calling Go methods via gRPC inside of React server actions.
